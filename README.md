* **Never expose UI nor port for socket connection on the production server.** 
    * If you need running socket server in production to be able to connect to it with UI App, **ALWAYS** run UI-App locally and use [ssh tunnel](https://blog.trackets.com/2014/05/17/ssh-tunnel-local-and-remote-port-forwarding-explained-with-examples.html) and make sure it's not accessible from the internet.

* If you want to use default storage plugin (recommended), you will need **Influx DB** installed.
    * https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads#influxdb and https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb
    * Start fb: `sudo service influxdb start`
    * `curl -XPOST "http://localhost:8086/query" --data-urlencode "q=CREATE DATABASE coinrat"`

    * Grand this user with R+W access to the database: `curl -XPOST "http://localhost:8086/query" --data-urlencode 'q=GRANT ALL ON "coinrat" TO "coinrat"'`

* Create virtual end and install Python dependencies
    * `python3.6 -m venv __venv__`
    * `. __venv__/bin/activate`
    * `python -m pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/ericsomdahl/python-bittrex.git` ([Package on Pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bittrex/0.1.4) is not up to date.) 
    * `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
    * `cp .env_example .env`
    * Configure `.env`

# Additional tips & tricks
* There is visualization tool for Influx DB called [Chronograf](https://github.com/influxdata/chronograf), it can be usefull for visualizing data too.
